## Welcome to **OpenForm**

At **OpenForm**, we believe that **building beautiful, powerful, and customizable forms** should be accessible to everyone. Our mission is to **empower creators, teams, and developers** to craft forms that fit their unique needsâ€”without limits, without complexity, and with full ownership of their data.

Weâ€™re starting with a **next-generation open-source form builder** that combines a sleek, intuitive interface with advanced featuresâ€”making form creation effortless, collaborative, and adaptable. This isnâ€™t just about forms; itâ€™s about **redefining how you collect, manage, and own your data**.

### The Movement: Democratizing Data Collection

For too long, form builders and data collection tools have been locked behind proprietary systems, limiting flexibility and control. But with the rise of open-source and community-driven projects, the power is shifting back to **the people**.

At **OpenForm**, weâ€™re not just creating a toolâ€”weâ€™re building a **movement** to make form building **transparent, customizable, and accessible** for everyone. Our goal is to **democratize data collection** and give you the tools to **own your forms and your data**.

### Why Weâ€™re Building This

Every creator, team, or individual has unique needs. Your forms should reflect thatâ€”**flexible, beautiful, and easy to use**. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re building **OpenForm**: to provide a **fully open, extensible platform** that adapts to your workflow, not the other way around.

**We want to empower you** to create forms that are as unique as your goals, with no vendor lock-in, no limits, and full control over your data.

- Offers **full customization** with themes, layouts, and integrations  
- Ensures **data privacy and ownership** at every step  
- Provides a **community-driven platform** for innovation and growth
